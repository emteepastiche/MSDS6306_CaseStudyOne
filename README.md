Case Study 1 Codebook

Study Design:

To complete this assignment, we used two CSV files, one containing American beers and the other American breweries. We used R. Markdown to compile these two data frames together and answer questions pertaining to the beersâ€™ alcoholic content and bitterness to present to the CEO and CFO of Budweiser.

Objects:

Beers: Data frame from Beers.csv

Breweries: Data frame from Breweries.csv

Q1: Data frame to show how many breweries per state

Beer_Data: Combined data frame to show all data from both Beers.CSV and Breweries.csv

ABV_Median: Data frame consisting of the ABV median by state

IBU_Median: Data frame consisting of the IBU median by state

Q4: Data frame that merges ABV_Median and IBU_Median
